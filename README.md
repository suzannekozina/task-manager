# Udacitask 2.0

## Project Overview

If you’re familiar with microblogging sites, you’ll know that they usually allow you to define different types of posts like “text”, “quote”, “image”, or  “link”. All of the posts are then listed in one big stream, with different formatting depending on the type of post.

You’ve decided to keep up with the current trends, and add similar features to Udacitask. Rather than limiting users to just to-do lists, Udacitask 2.0 will allow users to create a UdaciList, which will support a variety of item types including links, events, and to-do items.

In this project, you will use your knowledge of Ruby gems and Modules to add new features to Udacitask and refactor your code to improve scalability and organization.

## Why Does This Matter?

As projects get larger, and more complex, scalability and organization can become a challenge if it's not anticipated early on. Think about how the changes you make to your code in Udacitask 2.0 will help if you choose to expand the project even further.

## Completing this Project
* **The Basics**: add, delete, and all methods are written and functional. All code in app.rb returns expected output.
* **Errors**: `InvalidItemType`, `IndexExceedsListSize`, and `InvalidPriorityValue` are used appropriately.
* **Modules**: Formatting methods are in a module and included as a mixin. Error classes are organized in modules and called using the `::` operator.
* **Gems**: A **minimum of 3 gems** (you can use more!) are used in the project. `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` are updated appropriately.
